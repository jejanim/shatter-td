# Shatter-TD
A Warcraft 3 custom (fun) map.

## State of the map
Right now, development is limited down to bugfixes and small improvements. We really want to see Reforged first.
### Technical
I do not consider it stable for multiplayer, yet.
Since I really hate that scripting language combined with the lousy editor, almost everything was done using the World Editor thus underperforming as hell and almost likely leaking stuff.

### Balancing
We tried really hard to make one race very overpowered so we had a fun time testing. I think we can agree that "chosen" are massively op right now. Will fix that in the future (maybe) :)

## Who's to blame
First of all, the amazing people at the hive workshop. We did use a lot of stuff from their database (icons, models, guides, etc).

Next are the testers, seriously. I cannot imagine how many times they died due to bugs or balance issues or simply due to us messing stuff up.

Last but also least, the original author ([jejanim](https://github.com/jejanim)), who basically just threw stuff together to make it work (or not). 
Great job.

## Download
To get the most recent version, go to [latest-release](https://github.com/jejanim/shatter-td/releases/latest), download the file (zip) and extract the contents somewhere on your computer. Then simply copy the map file (.w3x) to wherever you want it to be so your game can pick it up.

## Suggestions/Bugs/etc
Are awesome, maybe open an issue - eventually someone will read it.
